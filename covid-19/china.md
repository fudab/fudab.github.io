### Abstract
> In the very early stage of an unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 started in the epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the Chinese government imposed by far the largest scale of strict travel restrictions on more than 11 million people (beyond) on January 23, 2020, amid the busiest period of the year for domestic travels (chunyun, travels made during the Lunar New Year). Such massive travel restrictions have caused dramatic reduction in travel volume, not only for the outflow from Wuhan (Hubei), but also nationwide. Control measures like this helps reduce the number of imported cases to other provinces, which can possibly slowdown the onset of epidemic outbreaks in other regions and potentially weaken the impact of the disease. Here, we are interested in estimating the effectiveness of such massive travel restrictions in the mitigation of disease impact using a data driven approach.

### Data
> The data we use in our research consist of three parts: the COVID-19 infection information, the census, as well as the migration information in China. We consider the data in a provincial level where 26 provinces as well as four municipalities are treated as individual compartments. The start date is January 13, 2020.
