### Correlation Between Mobility and the Stock Market

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <th align="center"><img width="600" src="./figures_us_be/US_mcorrelation.png"></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 8: Mobility and the S & P 500 index. Here we use the mobility index, which is a normalized value of the mobility. And we regard the sum of these values of all 50 states as the national mobility index. </td>

* #### Fortune 500 Companies and Zoom Video Communications

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <th align="center"><img width="800" src="./figures_us_be/US_mcorrelation_sm.png"></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 9: Mobility and the stock prices. We consider the Top 15 companies in the Fortune 500 list and also this most popular cloud-based videotelephony service. It seems that e-commerce (e.g Amazon) and pharmaceutical giants (e.g. UnitedHealth Group) are those least harmed by, or even benefit from the travel restriction. The stock price of Zoom surged to a record high at the very start, which may due to the warming up of online activities (e.g. meeting, teaching). However, this pattern did last for very long given that more and more security issues have been disclosed. </td>
