### Abstract
> The COVID-19 pandemic has upended everyone’s normal life, health crisis, lockdowns, and economic percussions in an unprecedented pace and scale. We will get over this pandemic but at what prices? Here we estimate the burden of COVID-19 in the United States, peak time, and total number of infections, in coming months.

### Data
> The data we use in our research consist of four parts: the COVID-19 infection information, the census, and the voting information of the United States as well as the migration information in China. We consider the data in a state level where 50 states as well as District of Columbia are treated as individual compartments. The start date is January 21, 2020.
