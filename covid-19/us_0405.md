### Parameter Estimation

We turncate the date to `April 5`.

In the ﬁgure legend, we show when the outbreak of COVID-19 in each state will peak under different scenarios. Without any strong and eﬀective measure of contact reduction, the peak time in most states will peak April and May but ﬂatten the curve would delay the peak in each state with huge variance. The ideal scenario can be achieved by a drastic lockdown, if made immediately effective, will cease and stall COVID-19 outbreaks in all states. The pandemic will immediately peak in the ﬁrst two weeks of April for most states and mid May the latest.</td>
